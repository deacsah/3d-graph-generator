# 3D graph generator / Abell model generator

A script that allows the user to create three dimensional graphs, define labels and edit colors.

The script was built for a friend in marketing (Murk!) to be able to generate an Abell model (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_F._Abell#Three_Dimensional_Business_Definition_model).

Please ask first before just using my code on your website, thanks :)
